/// should have type GtkWindowTopLevel; windows with this type are managed by the window manager 
/// and have a frame by default (call gtk::window::set_decorated() to toggle the frame). 
///
/// Windows with type GtkWindowPopUp are ignored by the window manager; window manager keybindings won't work on them, 
/// the window manager won't decorate the window with a frame, many GTK+ features that rely on the window manager will not work 
/// (e.g. resize grips and maximization/minimization). 
/// 
/// GGtkWindowPopUp is used to implement widgets such as gtk::Menu 
/// or tooltips that you normally don't think of as windows per se. Nearly all windows should be GtkWindowTopLevel.
